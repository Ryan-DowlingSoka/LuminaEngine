// Lumina job system, a fiber scheduler with counter-based dependencies.
//
// One worker thread per core drains lock-free MPMC job queues (one per priority). Each job runs on a
// pooled user-mode fiber. When a job waits on a counter it does NOT block the worker: the fiber is
// parked and the worker switches to other runnable work; the fiber is resumed later, possibly on a
// different worker (fibers migrate freely). That keeps every core productive, makes nested parallelism
// deadlock-free, and unlike a blocking wait the waiting stack is suspended rather than held.
//
// Non-worker ("external") threads, main/render/physics, are not on fibers. A WaitForCounter from an
// external thread keeps the old assist-wait behavior: it runs queued jobs inline until satisfied.
//
// This is the low-level core. The task-facing API (Task::ParallelFor / FTaskGraph / etc.)
// is layered on top in TaskSystem / TaskGraph.
